# Revix
A Web3 platform that empowers YouTube creators to securely register their content as intellectual property (IP) on Story Protocol while enabling transparent revenue sharing with investors. By bridging YouTubeâ€™s Web2 ecosystem with blockchain technology, we solve two critical challenges:

1. Identity Verification: Prove true ownership of YouTube content to prevent fraudulent IP claims.

2. Revenue Accountability: Automatically track and distribute ad revenue and IP royalties to investors.

For Creators: Protect your content, monetize remixes, and attract funding.
For Investors: Back creators with confidence through verifiable revenue streams.
